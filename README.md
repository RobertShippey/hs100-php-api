TPLink HS100/HS110 WiFi Smart Plug API. 

I am going to get one of these Smart Plugs soon, and undoubtedly I'll want to integrate it into future projects, so I wanted to get a head start on some kind of API. I found [hs100-api](https://github.com/plasticrake/hs100-api) but PHP is just a little more convenient for me, so I decided to reimplement it. 

The API is currently not stable and there **will** be breaking changes. 

## Credits
Many thanks to [plasticrake](https://github.com/plasticrake), whose JavaScript API [hs100-api](https://github.com/plasticrake/hs100-api) this project is heavily based on and strongly influenced by. 

Additional thanks to George Georgovassilis and Thomas Baust for figuring out the HS1XX encryption.
